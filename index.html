      <p>
        I’m a startup addict - I live, breathe and eat entrepreneurship day in and out. Whether it’s my own companies (one of which I was fortunate enough to sell to Verizon), advising rising stars or lending my time, ears and eyes to startups at the very beginning of their journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see startups as a marathon and I have a unique ability to see the road ahead, the twists, turns and forks in the road ahead. Based on this clear vision I am able to help plot out strategies in business, marketing, partnerships and product - tying them all together neatly in an executable action plan from the very first mile to the finish line. (Is there ever really a finish line? :) )
      </p>
      <p class="hidden-sm">
        I’m a natural born leader, a role I don’t take lightly. I see my teams as the greatest responsibility I’m given - providing the right balance of nurturing and nudging to get the best performance possible out of every single member - from Admins to C-Level.
      </p>
      <p class="hidden-md">
        I come to life when I’m on stage sharing thoughts, ideas and dreams. I have much to share with founders and business visionaries and the most exciting moment is when I see the spark in my eyes reflected in an audience member emphatic nod - and I know I have touched something in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been extremely fortunate with my career - and the 2 things that drive me are growing and giving. Both seeing how I can grow continuously myself while fostering growth  in others. Being able to combine the two - giving my time to others and helping them grow is the most satisfying part of my life. Tony Robbins said “The Secret to Living is Giving” - that resonates with me in every fiber of my being.

          Yoav mentored me as part of the 8200 EISP accelerator. During this time, Yoav made himself available to advise me on a weekly basis and whenever I had a need to consult him on any issue, big or small.
        </p>

          I would recommend contacting Yoav for advice and mentorship to any entrepreneur looking to start a new business.
